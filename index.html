  <h1>Privacy Policy<p> for<p> তাফহীমুল কুরআন</p> Al Quran ByWord</p></h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 17, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the app "তাফহীমুল কুরআন Al Quran ByWord" collects, uses, and protects your information. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to ensuring that your personal data is handled securely and transparently.</p>

  <h2>2. Information Collection & Usage</h2>
  <p>We collect limited device and user-provided information solely for voluntary donation member management:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device ID:</strong> We access your device’s unique identifier (e.g., Android ID) to verify voluntary donation membership. If the device ID changes (due to OS reset, update, reinstallation, or phone change), the membership may be canceled automatically without user notification.</li>
    <li><strong>Blood Donation Form:</strong> If submitted, your name, address, and phone number are stored via Google Spreadsheet, only for voluntary donation purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Online Ayah Saving:</strong> You may connect your Google Drive to save Ayah references in a spreadsheet. We do not access your Google credentials.</li>
    <li><strong>Online Wallet:</strong> This is a third-party script (hosted via Google Apps Script) that allows saving notes, bookmarks, files, etc., using your provided Gmail ID and Drive access. If you remove this permission from your Google account, the wallet will stop working properly.</li>
    <li><strong>Affiliate Program:</strong> This feature requires user registration with a password. The password is encrypted and unrecoverable — even by developers. If the user forgets the password, the affiliate program will become inaccessible, and any pending benefits may be canceled.</li>
    <li><strong>App Usage:</strong> Anonymous usage statistics and crash reports may be collected via Google Play Console for performance improvement.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Location Information</h2>
  <p>We do not request or collect precise device location (such as GPS or network-based location).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We only obtain the approximate country name from a public website (via HTTP request) to help customize certain content. This does not use device sensors and does not require location permissions.</li>
    <li>In features like Blood Donor Finder or Prayer Time Calculation, users may manually select a location using a map or list. This is based on user input, not system-generated data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Therefore, the app does not use Android’s location permissions or background location services.</p>

  <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To verify voluntary donation member status and restrict access to member-only content.</li>
    <li>To facilitate voluntary blood donation connections (user-submitted only).</li>
    <li>To manage affiliate program login and rewards.</li>
    <li>To store personalized content via the Wallet (if permitted).</li>
    <li>To improve app performance and fix issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties unless required by law or when you explicitly consent (e.g., for blood donation communication).</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use appropriate security practices to safeguard your information. However, please be aware that no internet transmission or electronic storage method is completely secure.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain your data only as long as necessary to support app functionality and comply with legal obligations.</p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to access, update, or delete your personal information. To request changes or deletions, contact us at:</p>

  </ul>

  <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be reflected on this page with the updated effective date.</p>
